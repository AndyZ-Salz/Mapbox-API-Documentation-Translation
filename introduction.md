## Introduction

The Mapbox web services APIs allow for programmatic access to Mapbox tools
and services. Use these APIs to retrieve information about your account,
upload and change resources, and use core Mapbox tools, like geocoding and
directions.

This documentation provides examples of six different techniques for accessing
Mapbox web services APIs:

- [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/)
- [Mapbox CLI](https://www.github.com/mapbox/mapbox-cli-py)
- [Mapbox JavaScript SDK](https://www.github.com/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-js)
- [Mapbox Python SDK](https://www.github.com/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-py)
- [Mapbox Java](https://www.github.com/mapbox/mapbox-java)
- Mapbox Swift/Objective-C libraries:
  - [MapboxGeocoder.swift](https://github.com/mapbox/MapboxGeocoder.swift)
  - [MapboxDirections.swift](https://github.com/mapbox/MapboxDirections.swift)
  - [MapboxStatic.swift](https://github.com/mapbox/MapboxStatic.swift)

Each library’s documentation provides information on installing the library and
how to use it.

This is REST API documentation: it’s the most technical level of documentation
for Mapbox’s web services. If you're looking to use a map in an application,
you probably want to use a [library like Mapbox GL JS or Mapbox Mobile](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/)
instead. The APIs described in this document are subject to Mapbox's
[Terms of Service](https://www.mapbox.com/tos/).
